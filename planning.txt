16^2 = 256 buttons
40 mines
group box size = 372x376
form size = 414x503

should be a custom option


what if i make the name of each button
the "hidden value" ie. whether it has
a mine or a number? then set that to 
the text if it has been clicked.

"make surrounding 0's also clicked" means
the numbers as well - any zero not on an
edge should have all its surroundings 
uncovered. Then if theres a zero connected
to it, it should go through same process
