btn_0_0 location: 6, 19
btn_1_0 location: 6, 41 (+22 each time)

btn_0_1 location: 28, 19 (+22)

size for each button, 23 height 23 width
textAlign = MiddleCenter
font = Microsoft Sans Serif, 8.25pt

16^2 = 256 buttons
40 mines


what if i make the name of each button
the "hidden value" ie. whether it has
a mine or a number? then set that to 
the text if it has been clicked.

"make surrounding 0's also clicked" means
the numbers as well - any zero not on an
edge should have all its surroundings 
uncovered. Then if theres a zero connected
to it, it should go through same process
